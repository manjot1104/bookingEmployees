# Therapist Photos Folder

This folder contains photos of all therapists.

## Folder Structure

Place therapist photos in this folder with the following naming convention:
- Use the therapist's email (without @domain.com) as the filename
- Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`
- Recommended size: 400x400px or larger (square format preferred)

## Example File Names

Based on therapist emails:
- `kumarsunil1002452.jpg` - Dr Sunil Kumar
- `prithvipadam.jpg` - Prithvi Padam
- `leekha.priyanka.jpg` - Priyanka Leekha
- `vanita734722.jpg` - Dr. Vanita Kumari
- `lordslove89.jpg` - Ramandeep Kaur
- `mitalisharma61196.jpg` - Dr. Mitali Sharma
- `rmudgil7198.jpg` - Dr. Ritu

## How It Works

The application will automatically:
1. Look for a photo file matching the therapist's email
2. If found, display the photo
3. If not found, display a circle with the therapist's initial

## Adding Photos

1. Save the photo file in this folder (`client/public/therapists/`)
2. Name it using the therapist's email (e.g., `kumarsunil1002452.jpg`)
3. The photo will automatically appear in the application
